# Elementary-Cellular-Automaton

app.py / results.html using space and @ as reference
new_app.py / new_result.html using 0 and 1 as reference

It seems like you want to create a basic Python application using Flask to implement an Elementary Cellular Automaton, and then convert the code to use 0s and 1s as references. Below are the steps you can follow:

**Step 1: Set up Flask**
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system. If not, you can download and install it from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Install Flask using pip, which is the Python package manager:
   
   ```
   pip install flask
   ```

**Step 2: Create Your Flask Application**

Create a directory for your project and create the following files:

- `app.py`: Your Flask application
- `results.html`: HTML template for displaying the results
- `new_app.py`: The updated version of your Flask application using 0s and 1s
- `new_result.html`: HTML template for the updated results
- `styles.css`: Styles for results.html/ new_result.html
- `README.md`: A readme file to document your project

**Step 3: Run Your Flask Application**

Open a terminal in your project directory and run your Flask application:

```bash
python app.py 
```
using space and @ as reference

```bash
python new_app.py 
```
using 0 and 1 as reference

Access the application in your web browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
